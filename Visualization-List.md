This markdown lists down all topics used for visualization.

## Frontier Exploration Node

* `/frontier_exploration_node/next_viewpoint` _(PointStamped)_ : to visualize the next best viewpoint generated by the exploration algorithm.
* `/frontier_exploration_node/frontiers` _(Marker)_ : to visualize the frontiers.

## Path Planner Node

* `/turtlebot_path_planner_node/path_marker` _(Marker)_ : to visualize the path generated by the path planner.

## DWA Controller Node

* `/controller_node/current_trajectory` _(Marker)_ : to visualize the trajectory of the robot. (NOTE: this is currently unavailable due to DWA not working.)
* `/controller_node/predicted_trajectory` _(Marker)_ : to visualize the predicted trajectory from the given linear and angular velocities (v and w). (NOTE: this is currently unavailable due to DWA not working.)
* `/controller_node/close_obstacles` _(Marker)_ : to visualize the obstacles within the dynamic window. (NOTE: this is currently unavailable due to DWA not working.)
* `/controller_node/list_pos_paths` _(Marker)_ : to visualize the possible states from which the DWA algorithm will pick the best state and send the corresponding velocities. (NOTE: this is currently unavailable due to DWA not working.)
* `/controller_node/goal_point` _(PointStamped)_ : to visualize the goal point (or waypoint) for the DWA controller.
